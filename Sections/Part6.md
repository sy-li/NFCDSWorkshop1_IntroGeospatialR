## Part 6: Resources

To further explore or troubleshoot issues in using R for geospatial analysis, consider taking advantage of these resources:

- [Spatial Data Science with R (terra/sf version)](https://rspatial.org/) - great thorough tutorial for spatial data analysis and modeling with R. 

   Note: There is an old [raster/sp version](https://rspatial.org/raster/index.html) available as well but the terra/sf version is recommended, as those packages will be retired by the end of 2023.

- [ND Udemy](https://nd.udemy.com/) - a website offering thousands of professional development and training videos, freely accessible by all Notre Dame students.

- [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) - excellent source for GIS-related troubleshooting.
