# Introduction to Geospatial R


## Workshop Overview

Welcome to the curriculum page for the Introduction to Geospatial R workshop.

This workshop will go over some of the basics of spatial data with R. Course contents will include brief introduction to GIS, necessary R knowledge preparation (such as tidy data, pipe operator, and ggplot), key libraries for geospatial analysis, and common examples of vector and raster data manipulation.

Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

## Workshop Learning Objectives

After completing this workshop, you will anticipate:

- Be familiar with general concepts about geospatial analysis.
- Learn how to implement basic spatial analysis and visualization with proper R functions.
- Become comfortable working with spatial data.
- Be able to find the resources if you are encountered with more complicated geospatial questions.

## Prerequisites:
- This workshop is designed for participants who are unfamiliar with geospatial analysis.
- Participants are expected to be comfortable working in the R programming language. 

## Primary Tools
- [R software environment](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- [RStudio desktop software](https://libcal.library.nd.edu/event/9797081)
